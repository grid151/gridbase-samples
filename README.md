Welcome to the repository of developer reference material and samples to get started with integrating the GridBase!

# Getting Started

To begin, contact your account representative to acquire an account and login credentials. Once you have signed-in for the first time, you will need to click the Settings menu at the top of the screen, and work with your account representative to configure integration credentials and complete any additional on-boarding steps to configure integrations for your organization.

Once initial onboarding is complete, you may then click the Developers menu at the top of the screen, where you will be presented with additional developer API documentation.
